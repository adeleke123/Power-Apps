## Exercise - Monitor incoming emails

You can create a flow that automatically performs one or more actions after it's triggered by an event. For example, the flow can monitor your Outlook inbox and when an email with a specific subject line and email address arrives, the flow will take the attachment and save it to a SharePoint library.

## Prerequisites
+ Microsoft Office 365
