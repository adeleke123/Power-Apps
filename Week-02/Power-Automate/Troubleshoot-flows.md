## Troubleshoot flows

In this unit, you'll learn how to troubleshoot common issues that might occur while you run your flows.

Identify the error
Before you can fix a flow, you must identify why it failed. You will get an email with a list of failures each week.

Select the Monitor and then Cloud flow activity on the left menu (or select the Activity tab in the mobile app), and then select your flow in the list that appears.
