## Summary

Let's quickly review what we covered in this module.

In this module, you learned the basics of Power Automate, including the difference between triggers and actions and how to create flows for yourself or your team. You created a flow that automatically saves email attachments, scheduled flows and even troubleshot them.

## Next steps
Now that you're introduced to Power Automate the next step would be to take a look at a few scenarios where it's used more often. One of the most commonly used flows is approvals and using templates.

Approvals help automate a request process, which includes email notification. Also, Power Automate comes with hundreds of templates, which are a great starting point to build a flow that you can customize as needed.
