## Create recurring flows

In this unit, you'll learn how to build prescheduled flows by using a trigger called recurrence. You'll build a flow for the Contoso marketing team that automatically pulls customer email addresses from a Microsoft Excel workbook on Microsoft OneDrive. You'll then set up the flow so that any new email addresses that anyone adds to the workbook are added to a MailChimp customer list once a day.

## Prerequisites
For this scenario, youâ€™ll need to make an Excel file with a table that contains the following columns: ContactEmail, FirstName, and LastName. Save the Excel file in OneDrive for Business. You'll connect to this file in step 9.
