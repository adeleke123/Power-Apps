## Introducing Power Automate

Welcome to Power Automate! In this module, you'll learn how to build flows.

If you're a beginner with Power Automate, this module will get you going. If you already have some experience, this module will tie concepts together and fill in the gaps.

Learning objectives
In this module, you will:

+ Learn what Power Automate is and how it can be used

## What is Power Automate?
Power Automate is an online workflow service that automates actions across the most common apps and services. For example, you can create a flow that adds a lead to Microsoft Dynamics 365 and a record in MailChimp whenever someone with more than 100 followers tweets about your company.

When you sign up, you can connect to more than 500 services, and can manage data either in the cloud or in on-premises sources like SharePoint and Microsoft SQL Server. The list of applications you can use with Power Automate grows constantly.

## What can you do with Power Automate?
You can use Power Automate to automate workflows between your favorite applications and services, sync files, get notifications, collect data, and much more.

For example, you can automate these tasks:

+ Instantly respond to high-priority notifications or emails.
+ Capture, track, and follow up with new sales leads.
+ Copy all email attachments to your OneDrive for Business account.
+ Collect data about your business, and share that information with your team.
+ Automate approval workflows.

A common use of Power Automate is to receive notifications. For example, you can instantly receive an email or a push notification on your phone whenever a sales lead is added to Dynamics 365 or Salesforce.

Power Automate, formerly known as `Microsoft Flow`, is a cloud-based service developed by Microsoft that allows users to create automated workflows between their favorite apps and services. It is part of the Microsoft Power Platform and is designed to streamline business processes and automate repetitive tasks without requiring any complex coding knowledge.

With Power Automate, users can easily connect different applications, services, and data sources to create automated workflows that facilitate data transfer, notifications, approvals, and more. The platform offers a wide range of pre-built templates and connectors to popular services such as Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Dynamics 365, Azure, and hundreds of other third-party applications like Twitter, Salesforce, Google Drive, and more.

## Key Concepts of Power Automate:

+ `Triggers:` Triggers initiate the workflow and specify when the automation should start. Common triggers include the arrival of an email, the creation of a new file, the addition of a record to a database, or a schedule-based trigger.

+ `Actions:` Actions are the steps performed in response to a trigger. These can be simple tasks like sending an email, creating a document, updating a record, or complex tasks involving conditional branching and data manipulations.

+ `Connectors:` Connectors are pre-built integrations that allow Power Automate to interact with various applications and services. Each connector represents a specific app or service and provides a set of actions and triggers unique to that service.

+ `Expressions and Conditions:` Power Automate uses expressions and conditions to enable dynamic decision-making and data manipulation within workflows. Expressions allow you to transform and manipulate data, while conditions enable branching and controlling the flow of the automation based on specific criteria.

+ `Approval Processes:` Power Automate allows you to implement approval processes, where certain actions require manual approval before proceeding. This is particularly useful for tasks like document approvals or expense reimbursement requests.

+ `Scopes and Loops:` Scopes and loops help you group actions and execute them repeatedly based on specific conditions. For example, you can loop through items in a list and perform an action on each item.

+ `Error Handling:` Power Automate provides error handling capabilities, allowing you to specify actions to be taken in case of errors during workflow execution.

+ `Mobile App:` Power Automate provides a mobile app that allows you to trigger and monitor workflows on the go, making it convenient for users to stay connected and respond to important events.

Power Automate empowers users to streamline their business processes, reduce manual work, and improve efficiency across various tasks and applications. Whether you need to automate simple day-to-day tasks or design complex business workflows, Power Automate offers a user-friendly and powerful solution to help you get things done more effectively.
