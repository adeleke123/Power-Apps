## Exercise - Share flows

Shared flows extend the potential of Power Automate to groups of people. After all, why should just one person enjoy the benefits of increased automation in his or her work environment?

## Here are some advantages of shared flows:

Multiple people can own and manage a flow together.
If the creator of a shared flow leaves the organization, the other owners of the flow can continue to run it.
All owners of a shared flow can view its history, manage its properties, edit it, add and remove owners, and delete it.
If you're the creator or an owner of a shared flow, you'll find it listed on the Shared with me tab in Power Automate
