## Core properties of controls

Controls are one of the biggest components of a Power App because implementation determines how your app interacts with your data, what actions are available to a user, and what conditions may need to be met before another action can be taken. You can configure the appearance and behavior of a control by setting one of its properties. Because controls are designed with specific use cases in mind, the properties for each control are slightly different. Let's take a look at some important properties to be aware of using a text and gallery control as an example.

+ `Default` - The initial value of a control before itâ€™s changed by the user. For example, when working with a Drop-down control you could set the default value to appear when users see the control.
