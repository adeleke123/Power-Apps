## Media

Media controls give the app designer a way to display and share an audio file or video file easily, take a picture, scan bar codes, etc.

For example, you need to build an employee safety training app. For the solution, you want to share a video with your employees and then have them acknowledge that theyâ€™ve completed the training. With the Video control, the safety video can be shown in the app and then the next screen would be a training acknowledgment form. Or maybe you have an expense report app and want to let users upload pictures of their receipts. By using the Camera control, the user can take a photo and attach the picture without leaving the app.

Here are some details about the Media controls that are available:
