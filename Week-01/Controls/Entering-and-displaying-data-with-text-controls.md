## Entering and displaying data with text controls

In Power Apps, text controls are used for all kinds of purposes, such as displaying text, numbers, dates, and calculating currency. For example, you could calculate the value of two Text input controls and display the results in a Label control.

There are several text controls that you could incorporate into your app. Each of these controls has a slightly different purpose and use case. For example, maybe you're creating an employee survey app, and you want to get employee feedback. In this scenario, you would use the Text input control and modify the Mode property to be Multiline instead of single line. Most likely, every app that you work with will have text controls so familiarizing yourself with these controls will be helpful as you develop your app. The following list details the different text controls that are available.
