## Introduction to controls

In Power Apps, you can add a variety of user interface (UI) elements to your canvas app and configure aspects of their appearance and behavior directly from the toolbar, Properties tab, or formula bar. These UI elements are called Controls. Many of the controls in Power Apps are just like the controls that you've used in other apps, such as labels, text-input boxes, drop-down lists, and navigation elements.

You can find all the controls available in Power Apps on the Insert tab.
