## Power Apps building blocks

Power Apps is a collection of services, apps, and connectors that work together to let you do much more than just view your data. You can act on your data and update it anywhere and from any device.

This unit explores each part of the following Power Apps components:

Power Apps Home Page - Apps start here, whether you build them from data, a sample app, or a blank screen.
Power Apps Mobile - Run your apps on Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, and Google Android devices.
Power Apps Admin Center - Manage Power Apps environments and other components.
