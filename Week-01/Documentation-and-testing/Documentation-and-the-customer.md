## Documentation and the customer

Good documentation is important to the successful rollout of a Power Apps application. In the previous units, we covered some tools that will help you document your testing. But there are other types of documentation to consider as you get ready to deploy your app such as:

## User instructions
Technical specifications and administrator instructions
Change ("bug") logs
Documentation can be in the form of remarks or labels inside of your app that users can see, formula in-line comments or documentation screens (for app owners/developers), or standalone instruction documents and videos for your customers. There's no set rule for what to provide and many means to provide documentation.
