## User interface testing

In this unit, we'll introduce you to some of the tools available for you to test your canvas apps. You'll find useful links to explore them further in order to find the best tools for testing your app.

## Tools to help you test canvas apps
Tools available for you to test your canvas apps include the Power Apps Test Studio and Monitor.

## Power Apps Test Studio
You can test inside of canvas apps with the built-in tool called Power Apps Test Studio. This tool can help you write, organize, and automate your tests for canvas apps. See Working with Test Studio for instructions on how to employ Test Studio.

## Monitor
When testing app performance, you can use Monitor to check network activity, similar to a network trace in the browser. The blog post Introducing Monitor to debug apps and improve performance provides more information on this feature. Also see: Debugging canvas apps with Monitor.

Monitor is an important tool for Power Apps, and we'll cover it again in more detail before the end of this learning module.
