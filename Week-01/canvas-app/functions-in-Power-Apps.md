## Exercise - Get started with functions in Power Apps

When using Microsoft Power Apps, you don't have to write complicated application code the way that a traditional developer does. However, you must express logic in an app and control its navigation, filtering, sorting, and other functionalities. This is where formulas come in.

If you've used Microsoft Excel functions, you should recognize the approach that Power Apps takes. This unit shows a couple of basic formulas for text formatting and then describes three of the formulas that Power Apps includes when it generates an app. With this information, you'll have a better idea of what formulas can do, and then you can also start to write your own.

### Get started with formulas and properties

The previous unit explored controls in all three screens of an app that Power Apps generated. In this section, youâ€™ll modify the properties of the label control to format the item price in the gallery.

By default, the price appears as a plain number without a currency symbol. Suppose that you want to add a dollar sign and change the text color based on the item's cost. For example, red if it's more than $5, but green otherwise. The following graphic shows the expected result.
