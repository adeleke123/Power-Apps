## Explore screens and controls in Power Apps

This unit examines the screens and other controls that define the behavior of apps that Microsoft Power Apps generates. All the details won't be covered; however, knowing more about how these apps work will help you build your own apps.

## Controls in Power Apps
A control is a UI element that produces an action or shows information. Many controls in Power Apps are similar to controls that you've used in other apps: labels, text-input boxes, drop-down lists, navigation elements, and so on.

In addition to these typical controls, Power Apps has more specialized controls, which you can find on the + Insert tab, which includes a search field to help you find what you're looking for.
