## Exercise - Share apps in Power Apps

You can share an app with specific users, groups, or your whole organization. When you share an app with other people, they can run it in a browser or in Microsoft Power Apps Mobile for Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, or Google Android.

Even better, you can give someone permission to update the app.

Prepare to share an app
There are two basic ways to share an app. You can either open the app that you want to share in Edit mode or from the Apps tab in the maker portal.

If you want to share an app while editing In Power Apps Studio, select the Share button from the upper right side of the header ribbon. (Note: you can only share an app that has been saved)
