## Exercise - Manage app versions in Power Apps

Microsoft Power Apps can help if you saved changes to an app that you shouldn't have or if something else goes wrong. For apps that you save in the cloud, Power Apps keeps a history of the changes that you make. You can view each version that you've saved and restore your app to a previous version if necessary. If you shared the app, the people whom you shared it with will also receive the restored version if you republish the app.

## View versions of your app
On make.powerapps.com, select Apps on the left pane.

In the list of apps, select the ellipsis (...) next to the app name and then select Details.
