This module explored how to design and create a mobile-optimized canvas app. By the definition of mobile-optimized, you can identify the design factors to consider in creating your application based on your specific business use cases. You learned about the benefits of a responsive design when building a canvas app from a blank template. Additionally, you learned how the different configurations and controls that contribute to a mobile-optimized experience can impact the final design of a canvas app. For a finished app, you can evaluate the performance of your application to make sure that it's performing at a level that's acceptable for users. Also, you can adjust the design based on different performance tuning techniques.
