## Learn about mobile-optimized apps

When you design and create a mobile-optimized canvas app from Power Apps, you'll need to consider several design components.

A mobile-optimized canvas app should have the following design characteristics:

A clearly defined purpose

A responsive design [Bring your own device (BYOD)]

Simplistic user interface

Intuitive navigation

External peripherals aren't required

Offline capabilities

Connectivity alerts

Seamless setup

Optimized for performance

Clearly defined purpose
A mobile-optimized application should have a clearly defined purpose. When people use apps in a mobile capacity, the fewest actions that are required to accomplish the task will directly correlate to a better user experience.

Determine if you want a single app with many different actions, such as a mobile warehouse application that will do all actions for maintaining inventory, or a single application for a specific purpose, such as creating customers. Then, ask yourself the following clarifying questions:

Is it easier to navigate back to a home page to complete different actions, or is it easier to exit the app to complete another action?

Is it a better experience for someone within an organization to navigate through multiple apps?

If a single application exists, does it try to do too much, therefore complicating the purpose?

When you're designing the forms for the app, make sure that each form has a purpose that you can define in a single, simple sentence. Avoid the urge to have a single form that contains too many purposes, such as creating customers and customer contacts. Instead, consider creating multiple forms, each with a specific purpose.

Responsive design
Any mobile application or website that is considered mobile-optimized should adapt to the application in which it's viewed.

For example, a website such as Microsoft.com can be viewed in desktop or mobile view. The application or website adjusts its layout for the design in which it's viewed. The following example shows Microsoft.com in a desktop view and then a mobile-optimized view.
