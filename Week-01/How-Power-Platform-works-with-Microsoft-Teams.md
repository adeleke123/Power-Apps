## Explore how Power Platform works with Microsoft Teams

When COVID-19 hit the world, organizations were forced to rethink how their work force gets things done. Many organizations switched their workers to work remotely. This introduced a need for better collaborative tools organizations can utilize.

Microsoft Teams has filled that need for many organizations. It provides a central point where users can collaborate with other users, have meetings, manage projects, and more. One key advantage of Microsoft Teams is how extensible and adaptable it is. This means organizations can build custom applications for Teams based on the needs of their users. Microsoft Power Platform is the innovative gateway to rapidly build Teams compatible apps using low-code attributes. All Power Platform components can be used with Microsoft Teams.

### Let’s examine them in a little more detail.

+ `Power BI:` The Power BI tab for Microsoft Teams adds support for reports in the Teams workspace and allows users to share interactive Power BI content and collaborate with others in Teams channels and chats. You can create packaged Power BI app content from scratch and distribute it as an app or create a template app in Power BI. Additionally, use the new Power BI app in Teams to bring your entire basic Power BI service experience into Teams.

+ `Power Apps:` The Power Apps app in Teams provides an integrated experience for app makers to create and edit apps and workflows within Teams. They can quickly publish and share the apps to team members. The members can use the apps without having to switch between multiple apps and services. For example, a company might create an incident reporting application that can be accessed directly from Microsoft Teams. When a user needs to report an incident, they can do so without ever needing to leave Microsoft Teams.

+ `Power Automate:` You can create flows to automate repetitive work tasks directly within the Teams environment with the Power Automate app in Teams. You can trigger a flow from any message in Microsoft Teams and use Adaptive Cards within Power Automate. Additionally, you can build flows to customize and add further value to Microsoft Teams from within the new Power Apps app in Teams.

+ `Power Virtual Agents:` The Virtual Agents app in Teams lets you create, manage, and publish conversational chatbots easily from within Teams. You can share your bots with other people in your organization to chat and get answers for their questions.

+ `Dataverse for Teams:` Dataverse for Teams is a built-in low-code data platform for Microsoft Teams that empowers users to build custom apps, bots, and flows directly in Microsoft Teams using Power Apps, Power Virtual Agents, and Power Automate.

+ `Virtual Assistant for Teams:` Virtual Assistant is a Microsoft open-source template that enables you to create a robust conversational solution while maintaining full control of user experience, organizational branding, and necessary data. You can configure your virtual assistant for integration into the Teams environment.

### Let’s look at an example.

Since the global pandemic hit in 2020, real estate companies have dramatically changed how they do business. First, all their real estate agents are remote workers now. Most of them come into the office once a month at the most. Since a majority of their workforce is mobile, being able to collaborate with team members is more important than ever. Their agents spend most of their day working in Microsoft Teams. It is important that they not only collaborate with other employees, but also perform day-to-day activities. By leveraging Power Platform with Teams, we can provide real estate agents with the following:

+ Dedicated Power Virtual Agent bots embedded in Microsoft Teams can be used to field by agents to field questions they might have, as well as help them with day-to-day tasks. For example, a chat bot could answer questions about open house protocols, as well as assist agents with scheduling open houses.

+ A dedicated expense submission app could be built using Dataverse for Teams to help agents submit expenses related to travel, staging, and open houses right for Teams.

+ Power BI reports that provide analytics around properties can be easily embedded inside Microsoft Teams.

In the image, we can see a dedicated chat bot inside Microsoft Teams that helps answer agents’ questions related to different things such as open house scheduling protocols.
