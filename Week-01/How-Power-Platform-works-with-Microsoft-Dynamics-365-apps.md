## Describe how Power Platform works with Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps

Dynamics 365 is a set of intelligent business applications that help organizations run their entire business and deliver greater results through predictive, AI-driven insights. From Finance and Intelligent Order Management to Sales and Customer Service, Dynamics 365 has a variety of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer engagement applications.

There are many ways that the Power Platform works with Dynamics 365 products. First, all Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps are what are referred to as model-driven applications. Model-driven applications are built using Power Apps. They are based on a data model store within Microsoft Dataverse. Components such as forms, views, charts, and dashboards are used to present data to end users.

Model-driven applications are not the only component of the Power Platform used by Dynamics 365 applications. Other Power Platform components used by Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps can include:

Power BI: The business analytics capabilities provided by Power BI are often used to connect to Dynamics 365 applications and provide important insight into an organization. These visualizations can then be used inside Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, or Customer Service.

Power Automate: Items called business process flows are the primary component in Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. They help provide a guide for people to get work done. For example, Dynamics 365 Sales includes business process flow that helps guide sellers beginning with a lead and ending with a closed sale.

Power Virtual Agents: Intelligent chatbots are becoming a regular part of customer support organizations. They can help to answer specific customer questions and deflect cases away from agents to reduce their workload. Dynamics 365 Customer Service can provide support across multiple channels to easily direct incoming phone calls, SMS, or Facebook messages to Power Virtual Agent bots first. The bot can then escalate to a live customer service agent working in Dynamics 365 Customer Service, as needed.

Power Pages: Many organizations provide customers with self-support options where customers can access a portal and find answers to questions, engage with support, or even open new support tickets. Power Pages makes it easy for organizations to create externally facing sites that connect to Dataverse that customers can access.
