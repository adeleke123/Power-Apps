### Explore how Microsoft Power Platform apps work together

Power Platform can add value to any business by helping you to analyze, act, and automate. Act by building custom apps in Power Apps, automate processes based on the data you collect in Power Automate, and analyze the data you have collected in Power BI.

Consider a business that has IT equipment for general use. Currently, equipment check-out is conducted by visiting the IT office, checking if the product is available, then writing your name with the equipment type in a notebook. Employees may have to visit IT several times before equipment becomes available, and IT personnel must drop their tasks to personally check on the equipment status or collect it for the employee. Sometimes employees hold onto the equipment for longer than they intend, and IT personnel spend time tracking it down. In addition, important equipment information such as serial numbers and warranty details are kept somewhere else in the IT office. How can Power Platform improve this process?

Power Apps allows us to build an app that has all equipment listed, the status of that equipment, and even important details such as use instructions. With their phone or tablet, employees can check out the available equipment then walk to IT at a specified pickup time, where the equipment will be ready along with all the necessary notes. Power Automate can read when equipment needs to be returned and send reminder emails to the employees. Users can see when equipment is booked through the app and request check-out for a future date. Power BI can take all the data generated from the app and analyze it to help your IT leaders understand what equipment is used most often and by whom. This way you can decide if you need to purchase additional equipment, if some users or departments need dedicated equipment, and when your equipment has reached the end of its usefulness.

This is only one common scenario in which Power Platform can transform the way businesses operate.

To expand on this a little more, let’s look at another example. Consider a real estate company that has a team of agents who work in the field meeting with potential sellers and showing properties to buyers. In addition to their agents, they also have a team of managers who are there to support their agents.

The real estate company's agents need the following:

Quickly search for active property listings while in the field.

Easily intake new properties when working with new sellers including capturing property details, snap pictures, and schedule open houses as needed.

The real estate company's managers need to be able to do the following:

Easily see which properties are currently listed.

Ensure that property inspections are conducted as needed.

Access important details such as how many offers have been made on a property and manage any incoming offers.

Easily identify similar properties in the area.

Have a singular area where they can analyze the current landscape of properties, they are selling, and drive business decisions based on those actions.

Additional information:

The real estate company uses Microsoft Outlook as their primary email application.

They use Microsoft Teams. Real estate agents spend a large portion of their day working in Microsoft Teams.

Let’s see how Power Platform could be used to create a tailored solution for our real estate company that provides everyone in their organization with the tools they need regardless of their needs.

Now that you have seen a few different examples, consider your own business and what processes take up valuable time and are a burden to customers or employees. How can you use Microsoft Power Platform to improve them?
