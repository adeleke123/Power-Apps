## Summary

In Power Apps, you can use many different controls, variables, and other functions to fully customize your user's navigation experience.

+ Use the Navigate function to send the user to any screen in your app.

+ Create other navigational functionality by using If statements, variables, and timer controls.

+ Use the Back function to send your users back to the screen that they previously navigated from.

Using a combination of different controls, properties, functions, and formulas, you can develop and deploy an app that's both functionally sound and simple to use. It should also be noted, just because you can add navigation in many ways doesn't mean it's always the best to do so. Think about your user's interaction with the app and keep it simple.
