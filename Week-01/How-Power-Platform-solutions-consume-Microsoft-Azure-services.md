## Describe how Power Platform solutions consume Microsoft Azure services

The Azure cloud platform consists of hundreds of products and cloud services designed to help you bring new solutions to life to solve today's and future challenges. These services range from data storage services to virtual machines, to artificial intelligence services. Microsoft Azure service provides you with the opportunity to build, run, and manage applications across multiple clouds, on-premises, and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of your choice.

Power Platform and Azure services are a perfect complement for each other, and the possibilities for using them together are endless. Azure services can be used with Power Platform to help modernize legacy systems, automate processes, and create advanced analytical solutions.

Letâ€™s look at an example of how an organization might use Azure and Power Platform.

The example demonstrates how you can deploy portals to automate manual or paper-based processes and surface a rich user experience. Employ Azure API management and Azure Functions to connect custom APIs, which tap into your legacy systems. By using Azure-managed databases and a low-code approach to automate tasks, you can lower the overall solution costs. You can quickly build apps that are real-time, resilient, and scalable.
