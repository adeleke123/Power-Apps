## Explore how Power Platform works with Microsoft Teams

When COVID-19 hit the world, organizations were forced to rethink how their work force gets things done. Many organizations switched their workers to work remotely. This introduced a need for better collaborative tools organizations can utilize.

Microsoft Teams has filled that need for many organizations. It provides a central point where users can collaborate with other users, have meetings, manage projects, and more. One key advantage of Microsoft Teams is how extensible and adaptable it is. This means organizations can build custom applications for Teams based on the needs of their users. Microsoft Power Platform is the innovative gateway to rapidly build Teams compatible apps using low-code attributes. All Power Platform components can be used with Microsoft Teams.
